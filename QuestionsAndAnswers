1.#Question
  fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git in Mac OS
  #Answer
  Just to be sure: if you create a file, you should not create in the .git/ folder itself, but in its parent folder:
    myrepo
      yourfile <===
      .git
  The .git/ folder include git data/metadata representing your git repo.
  The parent folder is the working tree of the repo.
  If you don't have a .git/ folder in "myrepo", type git init .
